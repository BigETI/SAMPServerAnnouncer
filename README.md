# SA:MP server announcer

## Description
This software is a drop-in replacement for the existing "announce" executables shipped with the San Andreas Multiplayer server packages.
Some servers are [compatible](https://github.com/AGraber/samp-compat) with multiple version of San Andreas Multiplayer clients, so they should be listed at their appropriate server lists.
This software requires a configuration file to be specified, where and how to announce the server for, which is documented at [documentation](https://github.com/BigETI/SAMPServerAnnouncer/wiki/Configuration).
Additionally this software supports [samp-server-api](https://github.com/Southclaws/samp-server-api), so server owners can display custom information for their servers.
