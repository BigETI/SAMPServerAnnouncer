# San Andreas Multiplayer server announcer

## Description
This software is a drop-in replacement for the existing "announce" executables shipped with the San Andreas Multiplayer server packages.

Some servers are [compatible](https://github.com/AGraber/samp-compat) with multiple versions of San Andreas Multiplayer clients, so logically they should be listed at their appropriate server lists.

This software requires a configuration file to be specified, where and how to announce the server, which is [documented](https://github.com/BigETI/SAMPServerAnnouncer/wiki/Configuration) at https://github.com/BigETI/SAMPServerAnnouncer/wiki/Configuration

Additionally this software supports [samp-servers-api](https://github.com/Southclaws/samp-servers-api), so server owners can display custom information for their servers.
